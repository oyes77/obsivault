## How to Introduce Yourself on Text MessageーTips

Writing a great introduction text is as simple as putting together the right building blocks. You need to know which information to put in….and what to leave out. 

### Include a Text Message Signature

One of the best ways to craft a [professional text](https://simpletexting.com/professional-text-message-examples/) is to include a signature.

Just like in an email, a text message signature generally tells your contacts who you are, what your job title is, any credentials you have, and the name of your company. 

That’s the usual recipe for a text signature, but there’s room to be creative. You can include your company’s slogan, extra contact information for you, or even your business hours. 

For a little inspiration, check out these [text signature examples](https://simpletexting.com/text-message-signature-examples/). 

### Keep it Short and to the Point

The only really important rule to follow when writing a text message introduction is to keep it focused. This isn’t the time to chat about the weatherーget the point across in as few words as possible.

Consider this example:

_Hi Martha! It’s Joan Newsom from the Las Vegas Realtor Conference. It was so great to connectーare you still interested in referrals?_

This message includes a polite greeting, the name of the sender, how the two connected, and a direct question that explains why the recipient is getting the text in the first place.

### Include Action Steps

When you send an introduction text, be sure you don’t just introduce yourself and leave your contact unsure about what to do next. 

Include a call to action or question that prompts a response, like, “Visit my calendar and choose a meeting time,” or, “Are you still available for a consultation?” 

This keeps the interaction moving and gives your contact a clear next step to follow.

### Keep Your Tone Conversational

Even though you’re sending your text in a business context, there’s no need to be too formal or stuffy. 

Keep your tone friendly and conversational. One of the biggest reasons texting is currently so popular is that it’s an intimate way to communicate. So, you’ll want to sound like a normal person in your messages.

You can even include [emojis](https://simpletexting.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-emoji-marketing/) for a little varietyーthey’ll make you sound even more approachable and personable.

With these tips in mind, we’ll give you a few templates you can use to start writing your own introduction texts.
