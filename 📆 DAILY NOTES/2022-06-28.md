**Color burn**  
The Color burn mode is named after the photography film development technique of “burning” or overexposing prints to make the colors darker. This blending mode darkens the colors and increases the contrast of the base colors, then blends the colors of the blending layer.

**Screen**  
The Screen mode inverts the base colors and multiplies with the colors of the blending layer. This creates the opposite effect of the Multiply mode. The resulting colors will be brighter than the original colors.

**Color dodge**  
The Color dodge mode lightens the colors of the base layers and reduces the contrast. This results in saturated mid-tones.

**Overlay**  
The Overlay mode behaves like Screen mode in bright areas, and like Multiply mode in darker areas. With this mode, the bright areas will look brighter and the dark areas will look darker.

**Soft light**  
The effect of the Soft light mode depends on the density of the superimposed color. Using bright colors on the blending layer will create a brighter effect like the dodge modes, while dark colors will create darker color like the burn modes. Any color placed above white areas will appear white.

**Difference**  
The Difference mode subtracts the colors of the blending layer from the base colors, keeps the resulting value and combines it with the original base colors.

### Example

We just covered the main blending modes you’ll need.  
Now let’s look at a simple example of how you can use blending modes in your art. This article uses the blending modes of Clip Studio Paint, but you can achieve similar effects in other graphics software with blending modes.

![](https://www.clipstudio.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/0001_020_en-us-1.jpg)

Create an orange gradient layer on top of the background image.

![](https://www.clipstudio.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/0001_021_en-us.jpg)

Select the layer with the orange gradient and set the blending mode to Hard light, then reduce the opacity to 85%.  
This makes the sky orange and transforms it from a daytime scene to a sunset scene.

By using blending modes like this, you can change the overall atmosphere of your illustrations. Blending modes can add a whole host of effects to your work. Use them wisely to open a whole new world of expressions!
